How I approched the solution?
first we need to scrape data which is required by using bs4 Beautiful soup.
Saved the scraped data in text format.
After that I use Natural Language Toolkit for performing Textual Analysis.
first I tokenized the word from text file and after that I removed the words that no need while performing Analysis.
According to the Text_analysis.docx I finded all the variables
And Saved to Output Data.csv

How to run file to generate output?
It will automatically scarpe all the URL's and convert saved to Output File
